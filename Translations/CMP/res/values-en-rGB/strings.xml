All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Motorola.\n\nCOPYRIGHT: The Software is owned by Motorola and is protected by United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.

You may NOT transfer the Software or any of your rights to the Software under this Agreement to another person or entity.\n\nHIGH RISK ACTIVITIES: The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, implantable human medical devices, external human life-support machines, explosives control devices, submarines, weapons systems, or in controlling the operation of moving motor vehicles, in which the failure of the Software could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage (\"High Risk Activities\"). You agree not to use the Software in High Risk Activities.\n\nU. S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS: The U. S. Government acknowledges Motorola\'s representation that the Software and its documentation were developed at private expense and no part of them is in the public domain and that the Software is Restricted Computer Software as that term is defined in Clause 52.227-19(FAR) and is Commercial Computer Software as that term is defined in Subpart 227.471 DFARS).\n\nRESTRICTED RIGHTS LEGEND: Where applicable, use, duplication or disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in subparagraph (c) (1) (ii) of the Rights of Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013.

You agree to comply with all regulatory sanctions or restrictions involving a party or an entity identified as Denied Parties or Specially Designated Nationals by the U.S. Department of Commerce and/or the U.S. Department of Treasury.\n\nDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES: Motorola does not warrant that the Software will meet your requirements, that operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free, or that all Software errors will be corrected. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Software is with you. \n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY MOTOROLA, ITS EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS, DEALERS OR AGENTS SHALL INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THE ABOVE WARRANTIES OR CREATE ANY NEW WARRANTIES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT EVENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.\n\nYOUR RECEIPT OF THE SOFTWARE HEREUNDER DOES NOT, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER, EXTEND ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES PROVIDED FOR ANY MOTOROLA DEVICE OR OTHER MOTOROLA SOFTWARE, PRODUCT, OR SERVICE.\n\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY: REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH IN THE WARRANTY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, IN NO EVENT WILL MOTOROLA BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR ANY DATA SUPPLIED THEREWITH EVEN IF MOTOROLA OR ANYONE ELSE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO CASE SHALL THE LIABILITY OF MOTOROLA EXCEED THE PRICE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE.\n\nTERM: This Agreement is effective until terminated.

This Agreement may not be modified or waived except in writing and signed by an officer or other authorized representative of each party. If any provision is held invalid, all other provisions shall remain valid, unless such invalidity would frustrate the purpose of our Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent action in the event of future breaches.</string>
