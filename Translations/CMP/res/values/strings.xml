You bear all risk of loss after purchase and for any loss of Digital Content you have downloaded, including any loss due to a computer or hard drive crash. We may, from time to time, remove Digital Content from the Service without notice.\n\n3. Software\n\n3.1  General. We may make available to you, from time to time, software for your use in connection with the Service (any and all such software, individually and collectively, the \"Software\").\n\n3.2  Use of the Software. You may use the Software only in connection with the Service. You may not separate any individual component of the Software for use other than in connection with the Service, may not incorporate any portion of it into your own programs or compile any portion of it in combination with your own programs, may not transfer it for use with another service, or use it, or any portion of it, over a network and may not sell, rent, lease, lend, loan, distribute or sub-license the Software or otherwise assign any rights to the Software in whole or in part.

You may not, and you will not encourage, assist or authorize any other person to, modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or otherwise tamper with, the Software, whether in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or of the Software. We may offer updates of the Software, from time to time, for feature enhancement, security or other purposes. We will not automatically update the Software, unless you authorize us to do so.\n\n3.4  Export Regulations; Government End Users. You agree to comply with all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce and other United States agencies and authorities that may apply to the Software. If you are a U.S. Government end user, we are licensing the Software to you as a \"Commercial Item\" as that term is defined in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (see 48 C.F.R. § 2.101), and the rights we grant you to the Software are the same as the rights we grant to all others under the Terms of Use.\n\n4. Reservation of Rights\n\nExcept for the rights explicitly granted to you in the Terms of Use, all right, title and interest in the Service, the Software and the Digital Content are reserved and retained by us, our Digital Content providers, and our licensors.

In case of such termination, you must cease all use of the Software and Digital Content, and we may immediately revoke your access to the Service without notice to you and without refund of any fees. Our failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with the Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights. We may amend any of the Terms of Use at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on the Service\'s website. Your continued use of the Service, the Software or the Digital Content after any such amendment\'s effective date evidences your agreement to be bound by it.\n\n6.3  Third-Party Beneficiaries. Digital Content copyright owners are intended third-party beneficiaries under the Terms of Use and may enforce the Terms of Use against you and invoke all rights hereunder including limitations of liability.\n\n6.4  Contact Information.
